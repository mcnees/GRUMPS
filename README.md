GRUMPS: General Relativity Using Multiple Processors and Symmetries

A Mathematica package for coordinate basis calculations of tensors that show up in general relativity and other gravitational theories. Calculations are performed in parallel across all available processors, and make use of symmetries to reduce the number of computations.
